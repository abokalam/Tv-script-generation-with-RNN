# Tv-script-generation-with-RNN

## Project Overview

This project is PROJECT 3 of my Deep learning class at UDACITY. In this project, I built a Recurrent neural network to generate a mall dialogue for a Simpson's TV script.

Recurrent Neural Network is a generalization of feedforward neural network that has an internal memory. RNN is recurrent in nature as it performs the same function for every input of data while the output of the current input depends on the past one computation. After producing the output, it is copied and sent back into the recurrent network. For making a decision, it considers the current input and the output that it has learned from the previous input.

## Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Udacity Workspaces (Recommended)

Udacity Workspaces provide remote connection to GPU-enabled instances right from the classroom. Refer to the classroom lesson for this project to find an overview of navigating & using Jupyter notebook Workspaces.

## Google COlab(Optional)

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with

> - Zero configuration required
> - Free access to GPUs
> - Easy sharing

## Install

> - Python 3
> - NumPy
> - TensorFlow 1.x
> - Keras 2.x
